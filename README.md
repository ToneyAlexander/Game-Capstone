# The Timeless Archipelago by Creaking Cog Creations

Download the built version of the game from: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~crawfis.3/cse786/2019Spring/CreakingCogCreations/The%20Timeless%20Archipelago.zip

Unzip the Install to your desired location.
The install comes with a folder called "place contents into LocalLow",
The following needs to be done for every windows user that will be playing the game
* Place the contents of that folder into C:\Users\<<username>>\AppData\LocalLow
* The final structure should look like this: C:\Users\<<username>>\AppData\LocalLow\CreakingC⚙️ogCreations\Game Capstone
* if you set up your users directory to not be on C: I assume you probably know enough about computers to find it.

Our game is not compatible with Macs, and was only tested on Windows 10.

After playing the game, a folder called Player will also be created in that directory,
If for whatever reason you need to fully clear the player, delete the Player folder in that directory.
Do not delete any other folders in that directory.

Some additional notes:
Our game does not come with a quit to main menu, use alt+f4 to quit.
To make sure saves work well, only alt+f4 from the hub scene.
If the save ever bugs out (rare but it can happen):
1. close the game
2. delete the Player folder at the previously mentioned location
3. run the game again
